### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - To consult about doubts that appeared.
- [mdn_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. I also like that it's available in many languages (very important!).
